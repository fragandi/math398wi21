-- there is some power n such that such that s^n = 0

-- Is this the same ideal over QQ and CC?

-- For each different term order...
-- Is the number of monomials in the complement the same?
-- It should be! 
-- Why? Because they are both isomorphic to S=R/I
-- (as vector spaces)


-- Notice that the ideal generate by I is the same as
-- the ideal generated by G

radical(I) == radical(ideal(gens G))


-- something to possibly play with:
-- check that the ideal of leading terms
-- (the monomial ideal generated by leading terms)
-- is indeed the ideal generated by the leading terms of G
